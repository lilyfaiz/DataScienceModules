# Tableau
well so what is tableau
so we kind of covered it briefly in the
last slide but it's just a business
intelligence slash data visualization
tool that allows you to make sense of
your data
really by by looking at it
right i mean
sometimes we're we're looking at
millions of rows of data you could check
maybe the first hundred or
you know first few thousand and look at
the data but that's really not efficient
and it's really not
it's really not feasible these days to
be able to
just look at the data and figure out
what's going on with big data and
there's millions tens of millions of
rows billions of rows potentially
and being able to throw this stuff
quickly into
a tool like tableau and look at it
really really helps a lot
so here you have tableau desktop and
then the server version so that we're
going to be using the desktop version
today specifically
tableau public which is free you can
download it for free from their website
and that's just the software that you
download to your computer and then the
server version actually
is within the browser you can create
charts and dashboards and then upload
that to the server for consumption
throughout your organization
so
the interface here for tableau desktop
is is really just drag and drop it
reminds me of a pivot table in excel so
you drag you know the columns and rows
around to get what you want
and and the way that this works is these
are the fields here
um and it's broken down into dimensions
and measures so a dimension i think of a
dimension as basically a category or a
categorical variable
and then a measure is a numerical value
so it could be the number of records it
could be any number of things
and then here you have
a filter you can apply a filter here
and i'll show you how to use this
section later the filter in the mark
section
but moving over here here's where you
placed your columns and rows
so if i want to basically
show in column form i want to be able to
let's just say pull in current status
here
to the columns and then number of
records to the row then it would give me
the current status categories along the
x-axis and then the volumes
for that category along the y-axis here
so we're going to go over this
with the live demo here but just want to
give you a brief introduction to the
interface
and and how it's set up
and this is the end result you know once
you're able to make a few charts you
could pull it together and make a
dashboard like this for example
so now we're going to go ahead and
download tableau public i've just
googled tableau public here
and you're gonna have to put in your
your email address here to
download the app
go ahead and put mine in there
and download it
may take a while
depending on your internet speed
but it's generally pretty quick
so go ahead and install that on your
computer
i'm going to fast forward the video here
so that
you don't have to watch this entire
install but feel free to
pause the video and
hit play again when you're
ready to go
okay so now i've downloaded tableau
public
i have
the shortcut here was installed on my
desktop
and here we needed to connect to a file
so it gives you several options here
excel text json access pdf spatial or
statistical file
and the difference between the tableau
public version and the tableau desktop
which is the paid version it's about 850
dollars is that you're you're limited to
just a handful of inputs here
hand just a handful of file types um the
desktop version really has has more
options here and you can you know you
can connect to a server like
um
azure or
any sort of cloud environment so aws
azure or google cloud and pull your data
in directly from there here
so we need to go ahead and get our data
set and the data set i'm going to use
for this tutorial
is the titanic data set from kaggle
and i'll include links to tableau public
and this data set
in the
video description you'll just click on
that
and you'll probably have to
sign up if you don't have a kaggle
account
already and basically what this is is
kaggle is is essentially just
sort of the online olympics for data
nerds
you you have competitions for machine
learning deep learning models
companies can actually
post their
their data sets on
kaggle and have
basically the best data scientists in
the world compete
to build the best model and the winner
can actually earn money so it's pretty
cool
so we're gonna go ahead and i've already
got an account so i'm gonna sign in here
and once you're logged in you can go to the data tab here and then we're gonna actually use train dot csv let's go ahead and download that i'm just going to go ahead and move that to my desktop
